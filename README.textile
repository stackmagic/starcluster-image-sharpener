h1. StarCluster based image sharpening with imagemagick

p. This is a collection of a few helper scripts I wrote a while ago when I had to sharpen a large amount of image files in a very specific (and cpu-intensive) way. The naming of the scripts is very simple: scripts with "local" in the name are meant to be run locally and those with "remote" are intended to run on the cluster master node.

* 01_local_copyscripts.sh
copies all scripts that need to be on the cluster to the master node

* 02_remote_setup.sh
installs imagemagick and sets up the inbox and outbox on the cluster master

* 03_local_upload.sh
uploads the images from the local outbox to the master

* 04_remote_submitjobs.sh
submits the images from the remote inbox to the cluster job queue

* 05_remote_executejobs.sh
the actual job script

* 06_local_retrieveresults.sh
downloads the images done from the remote outbox to the local outbox

p. The scripts 03, 04 and 06 can and should run at the same time in parallel to ensure a constant stream of uploading, processing and downloading
